# FAQ
## Why write in my name?

As RFK Jr.'s uncle once said, "Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country." And what better way to serve your country than by voting for a candidate who is neither a convicted felon, the oldest person ever inaugurated as President, nor the victim of a parasitic brain worm?

## Is this a meme?
Maybe. It really depends on:
- how many people think the 2024 US presidential election is a joke
- how much traction this gets
- how much (if any) money we raise
- how many states in which we can qualify as a write-in candidate

## Can you really be president?
Yes. I am a natural-born citizen of the United States (14th generation), over the age of 35, and have been a resident of the country for over 14 years. And if either Donald Trump or Joe Biden are competent enough to be president, then I certainly am as well.

## Are you serious?
Why not? I'm not saying I'm going to win, but I'm not saying I'm not going to win. And if I do win, I promise to be the best president I can be. And if I don't win, then I'll just go back to being a software engineer.

## What are your policies?
I'm not a politician, so I don't have any policies. But I do have some ideas:
- Surround myself with people smarter than me
- Listen to the experts
- Make decisions based on data
- Be honest and transparent
- Do what's best for the country
- Be humble and accountable

## How can I help?
You can help by spreading the word, donating money, or volunteering your time. You can also write in my name on your ballot in the 2024 US presidential election.
